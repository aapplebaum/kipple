# Downloading Kipple #
kipple has four primary components: data, models, resources, and scripts. Each component is of differing size -- e.g. kipple-data is ~300MB -- and so each is put into a separate GitHub repository. To download **everything** you can use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/aapplebaum/kipple.git --recursive
```
